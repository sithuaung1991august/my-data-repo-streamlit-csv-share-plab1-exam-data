,,This is your plan:,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"
- when you finish all the categories in the questions, you go with the second round of finishing up all the categories.
- Go through question bank's explanantion and go to related questions
- Go with wrong answers first
- And then flagged correct answers

- after that you will go with the weakest chapters, and you will revise them using other resources like Gems from the Plabable team, and Statpearls website
- then you have to go through roughly with mock tests (if you got great scores, then you go with a big mock, which was made for October 2024)
- then just relax and meditate throughout preparing for the exam.
- simulate some exam conditions (including searching for actual exam paper styles, and buying pencils and necessary things for the actual exam)
